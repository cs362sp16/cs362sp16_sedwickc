BEGIN DOCUMENTATION:

In writing cardtest3 to check village card I'm recieving errors in output.

Wrote printf to output the cards in hand and actions available for current 
player before and after cardEffect is called.

Number of cards in hand is increasing after call to cardEffect, actions not increasing.

Checking cardEffect function.

Village function doing correct steps.

Attempt to recompile and run again.

Still receiving error of hand size increasing by more than it should and not affecting 
actions.

Checking over oracle in test file for error in success/fail cases.

Success/fails are not broken.

Checking that correct card is being played from hand with call to cardEffect.

cardEffect sending value 13 (smithy) instead of value 14 (village).

Changed value from 13 to 14.

Recompiled and ran.

Getting correct result, tests passing.

In writing this unittest I found that Agan's ruls that if you haven't fixed something then it "ain't fixed." 
This becme clear when I recompiled the program without changing anything after seeing that the steps used for 
the village card appeared correct. I also attempted to use the "check the plug" method of looking at my test
oracle to see if the error was in my test and not the code itself. In this case my test was at fault. Keeping 
an audit trail also helped me in making sure I checked each part of the test that could be causing my issues.
