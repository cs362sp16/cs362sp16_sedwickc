There appears to be a problem wherein each player has 0 cards in their hand or deck after the game has been initialized.

To find this bug I attempted to play a card that is supposed to add a card to the player's hand which it did not. 
The player also started with 0 cards.

I would say this has a high priority and high severity because it almost effectively makes the game unplayable.
