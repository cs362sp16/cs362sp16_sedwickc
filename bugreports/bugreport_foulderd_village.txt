During testing of the card "village" in comparing results between my un edited version and foulgerd's 
I found that foulgerd's version adds three actions instead of two. 

In order to get this bug to occur you need only attempt to play the village card.

The severity of this card is low as it only affects a part of the game if the player chooses to play 
this card. The priority is medium as this card gives players more turns and can affect gameplay.
