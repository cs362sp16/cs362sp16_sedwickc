Unit Tests:

Test 1 I checked to see if there would be any errors thrown for testing 
the number of players in "initializeGame". The coverage I receved was 15.44% 
of 583.

Test 2 I checked the function "buyCard". My code coverage for my unti test 
was 20.75% of 583. To do this I checked each of the if cases for the 
buyCard function.

Test 3 I checked each and every value in the function getCost.
My code coverage following that was 25.39% of 583. I created and array of 
values and checked each and every index ginst it's corresponding value in 
"getCost."

Test 4 required that I test the value of coins in the gamestate after 
running the function "updateCoins." Coverage was 25.73% of 583. Checked 
value of hand at start, then replaced 2 cards with silver and gold and 
ran update. Then checked to see if value changed.
