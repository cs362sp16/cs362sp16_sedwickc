The changes I have made to the dominion.c file have been removing the innards of the switch statements pertaining to the cards smithy, adventurer, outpost, council_room, and great_hall and placing their functionality into specailly made functions for each card that is called when the switch case is met.

The function calls are essentially the name of the card they represent with an "f_" in front (e.g. "f_smithy()") in order to avoid confusion.
