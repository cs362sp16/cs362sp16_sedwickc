It is difficult to say who is correct because at a certain point my tester begins to make different plays between the two versions of dominion. 

There is evidence to suggest that there is a bug affecting the deck of my random tester.

This is not ideal for differential testing because I do not have the same method of testing for coverage as someone else does. 

In testing my version of dominion I was able to reach 61.56% code coverage.

In testing my classmateâ€™s version of dominion I reached 59.85% code coverage.
