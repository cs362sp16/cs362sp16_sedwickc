To run program: 

make clean
make randomtestresults.out

Should create "randomtestresults.out" file.

To develop my random testers I had two functions: an oracle function and the main function.

When creating my random test values I realized early on that some even though the 
"currentPlayer" value doesn't seem to change the way a certain function call works, it 
was throwing me seg. faults because it required a valid value for the function calls.
To fix this I assign a random value to currentPlayer that is either 1 or 0.

I was able to achieve 100% code coverage for the adventurer card as well as council_room 
and smithy. 

When comparing the unit tests to my random tests it appears that I received similar if not 
better code coverage with the random tests. When it comes to better fault detection 
capability I would say that the randomtests had better fault detection as I kept track of 
successful and failing runs within the oracle of each test.
